          		<p>The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) possesses unrivaled capability to deliver secure and compliant products and services across government at the best value possible. FAS contractors play a crucial role in this value proposition by actively managing their product catalogs to ensure only compliant products are offered to customer agencies.</p>
          		<p>FAS regularly analyzes Schedule contracts to ensure awarded products are not a threat to the federal supply chain and comply with statutory and regulatory requirements.</p>
          		<p>During the life of your contract, FAS may email your company’s point of contact for contract administration and/or authorized negotiators regarding potentially non-compliant products. If you are contacted, please respond to GSA in accordance with the instructions in the email you receive. In some cases, the product(s) may be compliant, but a response from you will be required in order to avoid removal of the product(s) from the contract.</p>
          		<p>You may be contacted regarding one of the following supply chain risks on your Schedule contract:</p>
          		<ul>
          		<li class="font-weight-bold">Country of Origin (COO) and other catalog issues (read more here)
          			<ul class="font-weight-light">
          				<li>Products that are not compliant with the Trade Agreements Act (see FAR clause 52.225-5)</li>
          				<li>Products that inaccurately list the country of origin as “US” in GSA Advantage</li>
          				<li>Identical products awarded on the same contract to the same Special Item Number (SIN) at different price points</li>
          			</ul>
          		</li>
          		<li class="font-weight-bold">Products with national security risks (read more here)
          			<ul class="font-weight-light">
          				<li>Hardware, software and services developed or provided by Kaspersky Lab (see FAR clause 52.204-23)</li>
          				<li>Certain telecommunication and video surveillance services (see FAR clause 52.204-25)</li>
          			</ul>
          		</li>
          		<li class="font-weight-bold">Essentially the Same (ETS) (read more here)
          			<ul class="font-weight-light">

          		</li>
          		</ul>

            	<h4 id="mas" class="font-weight-bold gsa-light-blue section-title">What is "Scope"?</h4>
          		<p>You must ask yourself, "Do the services or products that I’m providing fall within the descriptions of the Special Item Numbers (SINs) that I was awarded, and is the service or product authorized under my contract?."</p>
          		<p>An agency may add open market items onto an order if necessary. However, as a contractor, you must ensure that the customer is made aware of which items are contract items and which are open market items prior to the sale. This is extremely important due to differing Federal Acquisition Regulations for Federal Supply Schedule procurements versus open market procurements. For a contractor, it is important to document that you provided this information to the customer prior to the sale in a written quote or email correspondence, as well as upon the actual invoice.</p>
          		<p>It is imperative that all non contract or open market items are communicated and clearly identified to the customer so they can make the appropriate buying decisions. </p>
          		<p>If items you are selling to your customer are not on your Schedule contract, they can be procured by the agency through: </p>
          		<ul>
              		<li>OLM SIN or ANCILLARY SIN, if applicable 
              		</li>
              		<li>Open market procedures
              		</li>
          		</ul>
          		<p>You should identify them as "non-contract" or "open market" items. There are several avenues to expand your marketability and stay within the scope of your contract, including modifying your contract to add additional products, services, or SINs; and understanding and using Contractor Team Arrangements (CTAs).</p>
          		<p>Remaining within the scope of your contract is a critical contractor performance factor and will be evaluated on your contractor assessment report. Major efforts are being made governmentwide to educate both Schedule customers and contractors to ensure quotes and orders fall within the scope of the contract being utilized.</p>

				<p>The Trade Agreements Act (TAA) is the enabling statute that implements numerous multilateral and bilateral international trade agreements and other trade initiatives. The TAA applies to all GSA Schedule contracts unless otherwise stated in the solicitation or contract. The TAA limits the country of origin for products sold through your Schedule contract, in general, this means the following may be sold:</p>
				<ol>
          			<li>Articles that are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the U.S. or a designated country, or</li>
          			<li>Articles that are "substantially transformed" in the U.S. or a designated country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed.</li>
          		</ol>
          		<p>Remember that it is the responsibility of each Schedule contractor to ensure that product information is accurately incorporated into the contract and displayed on GSA Advantage throughout the life of the contract. It is a good practice to periodically review the country of origin of products offered on your GSA contract, as manufacturers sometimes change their manufacturing points. If you determine that a product country of origin has changed, the following directions can assist you in updating GSA Advantage.</p>

            	<p>Professional services labor employees are:</p>
          		<ul>
          			<li>Considered exempt from the Service Contract Act (SCA) such as those who qualify as executive, administrative, or professionals under the definitions provided in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. </li>

          			<li>Either supervise others, make decisions of importance and significance using independent judgment, and/or perform work primarily requiring advanced education and experience. </li>
          		</ul>	
          		<p>If providing professional services, your MAS contract will typically be awarded with labor categories, which will describe the minimum qualifications required of the person serving in that particular capacity. The minimum qualifications are established by your company during the pre-award phase or at the time labor categories are added to your MAS contract. Therefore, the labor categories will be unique to each contractor’s particular MAS contract.</p>
          		<p>For example, Company X has a labor category titled “Network Engineer”, which requires a bachelor’s degree and ten years of experience. Therefore, if Company X is bidding on a task order project, offers their “Network Engineer”, and is awarded the project, Company X must ensure the employee serving in this capacity has a bachelor’s degree and ten years of experience. Otherwise, Company X will be found to have provided unqualified labor for that particular project and is noncompliant with the terms and conditions of their MAS contract. </p> 
          		<p>This requirement cannot be waived by the ordering CO. If you find that you need to adjust your labor category qualification requirements or add additional labor categories, it may be possible. Contact your GSA PCO for additional information. </p>
          		<p>Industrial Operations Analysts (IOAs) review your labor as part of your compliance assessment. They may ask you to demonstrate the personnel provided on MAS task orders meet the qualifications and experience as provided in their respective MAS contract. Your IOA may ask to look at resumés, timesheets, and other personnel documentation to ensure you are indeed providing qualified labor on MAS task orders. The IOA will refer any issues found regarding the qualified labor provided to the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) for appropriate follow-on action.</p>
          		<p>If you have any questions regarding the specific labor you are providing and/or are not sure if the additional review is applicable to you, please contact your PCO. If you have questions related to the Contractor Assessment and the additional review of professional labor qualifications, please contact your IOA.</p>

          		<p>Federal Supply Schedule is simply another term for Multiple Award Schedule (MAS). FAR Section 8.4 of the FAR describes the procedures that must be followed when a federal customer is purchasing goods or services from a MAS contract. Contractors should be familiar with these requirements so that they are better prepared to generate quotes and accept orders from federal customers.</p>
          		<p>The MAS program simplifies the buying process while complying with federal procurement rules and regulations for vendors and government contracting officers alike. For example, when placing orders under MAS contracts, ordering activities do not need to seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement. This gives you an advantage over anyone who has not been awarded a MAS contract.</p>
          		<p>The FAR also states that before placing an order, an ordering activity shall consider all reasonably available information by surveying at least three Schedule contractors through GSA Advantage, or by reviewing the catalogs or price lists of at least three Schedule contractors. This is why it is paramount that each contractor’s price list and GSA Advantage file remains current at all times.</p>

    	          <p>In 2011, GSA’s Office of General Supplies and Services (GSS) began implementing a Supply Transformation (ST) initiative designed to modernize the business line’s wholesale and retail programs. ST resulted in a transition from the GSA stock based fulfillment model to a direct vendor-to-customer delivery model, which GSA refers to as Strategic Partner Delivery (SPD). The transition to the SPD model requires stringent vendor compliance with marking, labeling, and packaging requirements to ensure customers are able to receive and efficiently process incoming shipments. In order for shipments to be delivered to customers in a timely and efficient manner, vendors must mark, label, and package each shipment to the specific requirements, which are outlined on the following pages:

    	                  In addition to the MSLs, identification marking is required at the unit pack, intermediate pack, and exterior container levels to enable receipt process information and storage process information for accurate stock accounting of vendor sourced material.

    	                <p>In addition, in cooperation with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), GSA is exploring a way to make the Vendor Shipment Module (VSM) available to vendors who wish to automatically create and print a compliant commercial bill of lading, military shipping labels, packing slips address labels and small parcel carrier labels. The VSM system is a web based, front-end application interfaced to the Defense Security Service (DSS) mainframe. It is also capable of full Electronic Data Interface (EDI) integration at the vendor location. Although the EDI version is more complex and may require more programming in order to integrate it into production systems, the payoff includes higher volume shipping capacity and eliminates human intervention in the process.</p>
    	                <p>DLA has posted an informative video that explains the benefits of VSM and how to implement the VSM within your organization. For a "hands-on" experience while watching the video, you are encouraged to attain a DLA VSM account in order to log into DLA VSM. More information regarding the availability of GSA’s rollout of VSM will be forthcoming.</p>

    	                  OCONUS bound freight that is destined for a DoD customer or is being processed via the DLA transportation network may pass through a DLA Consolidation and Containerization Point (CCP). Certain products and shipments, however, are not eligible to go to the DLA CCP. See the CCP’s eligibility criteria (5-2010) for more information, particularly regarding marking and labeling requirements. Also see the CCP Eligibility Criteria Document (6-2008) which covers a much broader range of topics such as commodity codes, HazMat Codes, classified material. etc.

    	                <p>GSA has developed an agreement with DLA to process GSA shipments outside of the CCP eligible shipments through their facilities. Therefore, all GSA shipments for export through the DLA transportation network, will be processed through DLA CCPs for preparation to next nodes of transportation (Ocean Terminals, Aerial Ports, and Intermodal Hubs). The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command Customer / Carrier Advisory (January 15, 2015) CA-15-01/15-0006 provides the latest guidance on shipping through DLA CCPs. In addition, the GSA Freight Routing Guide covers much of the same information from the GSA perspective.</p>

EDI is the electronic interchange of business information using a standardized format. EDI transaction sets are utilized by GSA Global Supply to identify, process, and track all vendor direct orders. Vendor direct orders are orders that customers place through GSA and are processed and shipped directly by the vendor. The types of vendor direct orders that can be processed via EDI are:

Frustrated freight is particularly important as it directly costs GSA money to resolve the problems, can result in duplicative orders, and impedes agencies’ missions if they are not able to receive the necessary supplies.</p>

    	                  The purpose of the assessment is to help you succeed as a contractor. During the assessment, the IOA will verify that you are in compliance with some of the critical clauses of your contract as well as ensure you have an understanding of your responsibilities and opportunities. The IOA can be a valuable educational resource, helping answer any questions you have about your contract and can direct you to appropriate resources.

Once finalized, the CAR  is made available simultaneously to the contractor and the MAS Contracting Officer. The CAR provides valuable feedback regarding your firm's ability to satisfy important terms and conditions of your MAS contract.
