                                                        The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been
                                                        issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals
                                                        contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In
                                                        the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had
                                                        no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.
                                                        Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all
                                                        judicial appeal rights.

                A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in
                withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a
                determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such
                additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

                an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of
