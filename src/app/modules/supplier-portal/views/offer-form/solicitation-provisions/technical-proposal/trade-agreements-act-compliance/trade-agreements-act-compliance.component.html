            All proposed products must comply with the Trade Agreements Act (TAA). It is your responsibility to determine TAA
            compliance. When an item consists of components from various countries and the components are assembled in an additional
            country, the test to determine country of origin is "substantial transformation" (reference FAR 25.001(c)(2)). You can
            go to the Office of Regulations and Rulings within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which is the Federal agency
            responsible for making substantial transformation determinations, reference 19 CFR 177.23. CBP's determinations or
            opinions are based upon tariff laws. You may also request an opinion from a third-party expert or make the determination
            itself. The Internet address for CBP is: http://www.cbp.gov/. You should keep this requirement in mind when completing
            the TAA certification section of its SAM registration. When evaluating offers, the contracting officer will rely solely
            on the representations and certifications of your organization and will not make substantial transformation
            determinations.
